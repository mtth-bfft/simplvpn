# simplvpn

This standalone script allows you to manage configuration files for an OpenVPN server and multiple clients using only one-liners, and no OpenSSL command.

Unlike its predecessors, it does not rely on easy-rsa, it is fairly straightforward to parse and understand (< 250 lines), and doesn't try to cover all your possible needs with dozens of commandline options. Instead, you are given a "sane" OpenVPN configuration file, which you are encouraged to read and understand, and which you can edit if it doesn't suit you.

## Usage

Clone this project using Git, or just wget the script, then *read it*.

    git clone https://github.com/mtth-bfft/simplvpn.git /srv/openvpn/

### Without Docker:

Initialise a certification authority, a server configuration, and a client configuration template in the same directory:

    ./simplvpn.sh init

Modify `server.conf` and `client_template.conf` (you will especially need to setup the *remote* and *port* parts, but you might want to disable compression, change the cipher suite, etc.)

Issue certificates and create all-in-one configuration files for each of your clients (each must have a unique ID containing only letters, digits, underscores and dashes):

    ./simplvpn.sh issue "my-client-name"
    ./simplvpn.sh issue "another-self-explanatory-id"
    ./simplvpn.sh list

If a client profile or private key gets leaked, or if you lose access to it, you might want to prevent that profile from being used:

    ./simplvpn.sh revoke "my-client-name"

If you want to remove *all configuration files, certificates, private keys, and profiles* after your tests, simply run: (like all other commands, it will prompt you before modifying anything, except if you use the -y option)

    ./simplvpn.sh cleanup

### With Docker:

Run commands as in the previous case, but prefixed with the following Docker options:

    docker run -it --rm -v /your/config/dir/:/etc/openvpn/ mtthbfft/simplvpn init
    docker run -it --rm -v /your/config/dir/:/etc/openvpn/ mtthbfft/simplvpn /etc/openvpn/simplvpn.sh issue "your-client"
    docker run -d -v /your/config/dir/:/etc/openvpn/ --restart unless-stopped -p 9090:9090 --cap-add NET_ADMIN mtthbfft/simplvpn

Finally, you only have to send an all-in-one `.ovpn` file to your client.

## Recommendations:

1. Read OpenVPN's [documentation](https://openvpn.net/howto.html)
2. Read the contents of this script, and understand at least its basic steps;
3. As recommended in [simplca.sh](https://github.com/mtth-bfft/simplca), handle CA operations offline, or at least move
   client private keys and .ovpn profiles offline once they are generated.
